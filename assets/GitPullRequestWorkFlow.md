# How we work with git

* If this is the first time making changes: clone the project into desired local folder.
* Do `git checkout - b <newBranchName>`
* Now commit and push a normal to this branch
* When you are satisfied with your changes do a final commit and push.
* Go to [github](https://github.com/iths-devs/sommarprojektet). You should see a button that says **"Create Pull Request"**
* Type a message describing the changes made in the branch.

### Note that every Pull Request needs 2 approved reviews to be merged into main
* Once the merge is done remove the branch
